Thank you for visiting. My name is bryan and I am currently studying mathematics with an emphasis on computer science and a minor in statistics over in at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) over in
San Luis Obispo (SLO). I specialize in data science, coding, and the mathematical statistics required for machine learning. Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are other fields that interest me and I plan 
do research for atomic physics and quantum computing with Professor Katharina Gillen in Spring 2021. In school I am involved in the Women in Science and Women in Math club and I hold bootcamps for coding and data science
several days a week. Feel free to contact me for any questions regarding my work.
